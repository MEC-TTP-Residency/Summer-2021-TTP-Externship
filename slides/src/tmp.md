Imagine you have this calculation to do 10 places in your code:

  ```javascript
  1+2+1
  ```
If the calculation changes, you have to change it 10 times

Now, if you name this calculation with a variable name

  ```javascript
  math = 1+2+1
  ```

And you use the variable instead 10 times in the code
  ```javascript
  answer = math
  ```

Now if the calculation changes, you you only need to change it 1 time
  ```javascript
  math = 1+7+1
  ```
