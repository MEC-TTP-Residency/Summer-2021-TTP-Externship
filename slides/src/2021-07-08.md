# CSS Selectors Resource

CSS Selectors can get **complicated**. Fortunately, W3 Schools has a magnificent resource:

It even covers **psuedo selectors** like :hover that powers some amazing interactions.

# Frameworks

---

# Coders are lazy

## so they share code with each other instead of reinventing the wheel!

---

# Frameworks

Code is often packaged in a way that it is reusable and transportable, so that more complex projects can be built upon them. These are often called *frameworks, packages, modules, or libraries*. It makes for a mutually supportive, open source coding community where people can focus on individual parts to make sure that they are highly polished, secure, and up to date.

**Example** 75% of code for the Share Meals app is built upon someone else's code.

# Materialize CSS

One beautiful CSS framework is called Materialize CSS. It provides an **easy** way to build webpages that conform to Google's Material Design specifications. We include it in our repl projects via CDN:

Quick note about CDNs: their name means Content Delivery Network and is a way to deliver static files rapidly and with high reliability.
