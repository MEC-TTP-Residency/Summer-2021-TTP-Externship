# Control Structures
## Rules and instructions for how to manipulate data under different conditions or until a certain condition is met

Control Structures simply tell the computer which lines of code to execute next. 

Sometimes control structures are called **flow of control** (different from **flow of data**).

Control Structures give your code the ability to make decisions.

# More on Control Structures
## There are basically 3 types of Control Structures 

1. **Sequential** the computer will execute code one line at a time from top to bottom, left to right like reading a book
2. **Conditional** the computer will execute code depending on a condition being true or false
3. **Iteration** the computer will repeat some code until a condition is either true or false

## Normal order

This is the normal path the computer takes: it will execute code one line at a time from top to bottom. Simple.
```javascript
let priceOfCandy = 3
let moneyInMyPocket = 4
let howMuchCandy = Math.floor( moneyInMyPocket / priceOfCandy )

console.log(`I can only buy ${howMuchCany} pieces of candy!`)
```

# More on Control Structures

This can be a simgle branch using an **if** statement.
```javascript
if ( condition ) {
  // execute the code in here if the condition is true
}
```
---
# More on Control Structures

This can be a double branch using **if** and **else**.
```javascript
if ( condition ) {
  // execute the code in here if the condition is true
} else {
  // execute this code if condition is false
}
```

# More on Control Structures

Or it can have as many branches as you like.
```javascript
if ( condition 1 ) 
{ 
  // execute the code in here if the condition 1 is true
} else if ( condition 2 ) {
  // execute this code if condition 1 is false AND condition 2 is true
} 
  ..
  ..
  else if ( condition N ) {
    // run this code if every condition before here has been false AND condition N is true
}

```
