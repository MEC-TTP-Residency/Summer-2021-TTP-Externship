# Review

- Why is HTML important to learn?
- What is the general syntax for an HTML tag?
- What does the following sentence mean:  
**Tags are processed in a stack like fashion**

# Intro to your Final Projects

As a class, we will be assembling a virtual escape room together. You will be placed into groups of 2-4 and will be in charge of designing one virtual room.

This virtual room will be an HTML page featuring advanced JS and CSS that presents 1+ puzzles or games. Visitors will have to pass complete your room to move onto the next.

---

# Final Project Tech Stack

- HTML
- JS, specifically jQuery
- CSS, specifically Materialize CSS
- plus any other frameworks you want!

# HTML Tag Attributes 1/2

You can pass extra information to tags using attributes, much like you would pass arguments to a function. These attributes happen *in the opening tag only* and between the `<tagname` and corresponding `>` parts and take the form of `key="value"` Here's an example:

`<img src="https://bit.ly/38kh8Lg" />`

---

# HTML Tag Attributes 2/2

Attributes are optional, but certain tags need them to be of any practical use. An `<img />` tag without a `src` will not display anything. For other tags, attributes are enhancing. eg:

`<input></input>`  
`<input type="checkbox"></input>`

Tags can have unlimited attributes. Only a handful of attribute key names are valid and mean something; invalid attributes are recorded but generally ignored. Attributes *never* appear in the closing tag.

# One more note about HTML

```
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- this is an HTML comment -->
    <!-- this section contains meta information about the page -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- this section contains everything to be rendered and shown on the web browser -->
  </body>
</html>
```

# Popcorn Lab

Continue working on your resume project from yesterday. Explore W3 Schools for some inspiration (try to stick to HTML elements) and use your TA for help!

[https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)

At the end of your breakout room, **everyone** share new, awesome 1 thing you discovered. When we return, we'll ask **1 student from each breakout room** to share what they discovered!

# HTML Nesting

Often times, it is important to organize data on an HTML page. This lets you achieve visual layouts that are easier to read.

This is accomplished through a combination of **nested HTML** and **CSS**.
