# Data Structures
## A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer

Data Structures

- Arrays
- Objects
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Binary Trees
- Heaps
- Hashes
- etc...

# More on Data Structures

"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships." -- Linus Torvalds

Different Data Structures are better for different purposes.

# Data Structures: Arrays
## Arrays

We can put data into a list for the computer. We call lists **_arrays_**

_Arrays_ are the most common data structure used


---
# Data Structures: Array Examples

**NOT an array**

myDog = "Spot"

amznStock = 3000

todays_tip = 20

my_name = "Juan"

my_b_day = 20

{.column}

**ARRAYS**

dogs_I_walk = ["Spot", "Danger", "Fluffy"]

amznPast3Days = [3487.54, 3502.43, 3510.73]

weeks_tips = [20, 15, 30, 56, 3]

instructors = ["Juan", "Jon", "Darren", "Ray", "Elvis"]

b_days_4_lottery = [ 3, 17, 30, 20, 9, 24 ]

# Data Structures: Arrays

In JavaScript there are built-in functions we can call on Arrays:
- ```insert()```
- ```get()```
- ```delete()```
- ```size()```
- ```IndexOf()```
- ...and many others: [From the manual](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#)

# Data Structures: Arrays

Create an Array
```javascript
let fruits = ['apples', 'oranges']
```
Get how many items are in an array
```javascript
let size_of_fruits = fruits.length
```
    or
```javascript
let size_of_fruits = fruits.size()
```
Add an element to an array
```javascript
fruits.push('grapes');
```

---
# Data Structures: Arrays

Every _element_ in an array has an **_index_**. It is a number you can use to refer to the element.

The indexes of an array start at 0.

The syntax used to refer to an element by _index_ is to give the name of the array, followed by the _index_ inside square brackets: ```<name of array>[ _index_ ]```

So, if I want to get the first element of an array, I reference the 0th  index the array in the brackets:
```javascript
console.log( "The FIRST fruit on my list is: ", fruits[0] );
```

If I want to get the _second_ element of an array, I reference index 1 in the brackets:
```javascript
console.log( "The SECOND fruit on my list is: ", fruits[1] );
```

# Data Structures: Arrays

Now that we know how to reference get the individual elements in an array, we can _loop_ through the array and print each element, one at a time:
```javascript
for ( i=0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
    console.log( fruits[i] );
}
```

# Data Structures: Arrays

Let's say we want to average out the grades for every student in a class. We can store all the grades in an array:
```javascript
let allGrades = [ 67, 57, 49, 78, 87, 98, 66, 72, 72, 51, 93, 95 ]
```

Now we can loop through the grades, add them up, and divide by the number of grades we have:
```javascript
function averageGrades( arrayOfGrades ) {
    let totalOfAllGrades = 0;
    for ( i=0; i < arrayOfGrades.length; i++) {
        totalOfAllGrades = totalOfAllGrades + arrayOfGrades[i];
    }
    return totalOfAllGrades;
}

console.log( averageGrades( allGrades ) );
```

# Data Structures: Stacks & Queues

Arrays can be used in many different ways. 

Some of these we consider to be other data structures.

- **Stacks** - are arrays where **_LAST_** thing to be added is the **_FIRST_** thing to be removed

- **_Queues_** - are arrays where the **_FIRST_** thing to be added is the **_FIRST_** thing to be removed

---
# Data Structures: Stacks

Examples of Stacks in the real world:

- Trays in a cafeteria
- Plates in a cubboard
- A driveway that's only one-car wide

Examples of Stacks in computers:

- Backward & forward buttons in your browser

---
# Data Structures: Queues

Examples of Queues in the real world:

- A ticket line
- A car wash
- An escalator

Examples of Queues in computers:

- A printer queue
