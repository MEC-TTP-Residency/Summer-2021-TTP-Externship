# Live Coding Demo

We will continue exploring Materialize Components.

For this example, let's build a trading card for our epic 50ft robot together!

**Remember**: you can blend both CSS style sheets and Materialize CSS together. If you know of other framework or components, you can use them too!

# Virtual Escape Room Puzzles Brainstorm

We have been learning the visual technologies of web development: HTML and CSS. Next week, we'll begin exploring jQuery, a JS framework to add interactivity. These will be the core foundation to build our puzzles for the final project.

Let's begin brainstorming together ideas for puzzles that we can build. We have already seen some from the instructional staff.

**Also** begin thinking about groups that you might want to form. If you know you enjoy working with certain students, we will try to accommodate!
