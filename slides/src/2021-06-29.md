# JS Control Structures

Usually, a program runs from line 1 straight down to line 100 (or whatever the last line of code is). However, we frequently want to skip some lines of code, or go back to a previous line, or execute the same lines of code multiple times. We accomplish this in 4 ways:

---

# Main JS Control Structures

```
- if( /* condition */ ){ /* code */ }
- if( /* condition */ ){ /* code */ }
  else{ /* code */ }
- for( /*init*/; /*condition*/; /*step*/)
  { /* code */ }
- while( /* condition */ )
  { /* code */ }
```

# JS Functions

A function is a repeatable piece of code. It takes inputs and treats them like variables, so that the code can be applicable to a wide range of areas.

---

# JS Function Code Pattern
```
// declaring a function
function NAME(ARGUMENT1, ARGUMENT2){
	/* code */
}

// using a function
let response = NAME(ARGUMENT1, ARGUMENT2)
```
