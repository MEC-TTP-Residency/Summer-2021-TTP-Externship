# TTP Full Stack Bootcamp
## Session 2: Review of Coding Concpets I

---

# Outline for today

- Review something from past classes
- Data Flow
- Variables
- Syntax

---

# Review

- Everyone should have a GitHub personal account

---

# General Notes

---

# Why Review the Basics?

- You're going to learn many programming languates

- Each with new terms and concepts
- These will be very overwhelming if you don't have the basics of how computer science works down pat
- Plus you'll learn languages much faster if you have the basics solid
- Tech stacks change often. The basics don't.

# What Are the Fundamentals?

- The Flow of Data

- Syntax
- Variables
- Control Structures
- Functions

---

# Data Flow
## Programming is all about the flow of data into, inside and out of a program

- Programs essentially combine or transform input data with their own internall data to produce resulting data or to execute some helpfull task for someone 
- Data is usually represented by data types; words, numbers and other more complex data. They can be put into 3 groups:
  - **strings** - words, sentences, etc
  - **numerical data** - numbers for calculations or algorithms
  - **other** - like Boolean or Null values

# Variables
## Variables are names given to a piece of data

Why name your data?
- Once you've named some data, you can refer to that data again as many times as you want in the rest of the program
- You don't always know what your data is beforehand
- you don't want the program to forget what the data means when you need it later

---

# Syntax
## Syntax is the ORDER that you're ALLOWED to put Variables and keywords in your program

- Syntax is similar in the English language - verbs, nouns and punctuation have to be in the right order in sentence, otherwise it might not be understood
- If your Syntax is wrong, your progarm might run things in the wrong order or simply not work at all
>> "Syntax is probably the toughest hurdle for new programmers to overcome"
-- Java Developer

# Control Structures
## Rules and instructions for how to manipulate data under different conditions or until a certain condition is met

Real-life parallels:
- the instructions given to a bar tender not to let anyone in under 21 years of age
- the instructions for a baker to fold and roll dough exactly 4 times
- the instructions for a car owner to fill their tires with air only up to a certain PSI
