# TTP Full Stack Bootcamp
## Session 2: Review of Coding Concpets I

---

# Outline for today

- Review something from past classes
- Data Flow
- Variables
- Syntax

---

# Review

- Everyone should have a GitHub personal account

---

# General Notes

---

# Why Review the Basics?

- You're going to learn many programming languates

- Each with new terms and concepts
- These will be very overwhelming if you don't have the basics of how computer science works down pat
- Plus you'll learn languages much faster if you have the basics solid
- Tech stacks change often. The basics don't.

# What Are the Fundamentals?

- The Flow of Data
- Syntax
- Variables
- Control Structures
- Functions

---

# Data Flow
## Programming is all about the flow of data into, inside and out of a program

- Programs essentially combine or transform input data with their own internal data to produce resulting data or to execute some helpfull task for someone 
- Data is usually represented by data types; words, numbers and other more complex data. They can be put into 3 groups:
  - **strings** - words, sentences, etc
  - **numerical data** - numbers for calculations or algorithms
  - **other** - like Boolean or Null values

# More on Data Flow
## Input

- **Input:** Data can be input using the keyboard, touch screen, text editor, redirected from another program, and many other ways. <u>For Example:</u> when you login to anything, you're providing your username and password as input. 

---
# More on Data Flow
## Processing

- **Data Processing:** Once any program or app has taken it's input, it can do anything with it. <u>For Example:</u> your password may be encrypted, then sent together with your username to a server for authentication

---
# More on Data Flow
## Output

- **Output:** Programs will output data - to the screen, speakers, a database, etc.
<u>For Example:</u> the output of your login could be to tell you that your username and password doesn't match.

# Variables
## Variables are names given to a piece of data

Why name your data?
- Once you've named some data, you can refer to that data again as many times as you want in the rest of the program
- You don't always know what your data is beforehand
- you don't want the program to forget what the data means when you need it later

---

# More on Variables

Imagine you have this calculation to do 10 places in your code:

  ```javascript
  1+2+1
  ```
If the calculation changes, you have to change it 10 times

---

# More on Variables

Now, if you name this calculation with a variable name

  ```javascript
  math = 1+2+1
  ```

And you use the variable instead the 10 times in the code
  ```javascript
  answer = math
  ```

Now if the calculation changes, you you only need to change it 1 time
  ```javascript
  math = 1+7+1
  ```
---
# Declaring and Initializing Variables

In JavaScript you usually DECLARE variables and INITIALIZE them at the same time 

  ```javascript
  let math = 1+2+1
  ```

---
# Setting Variables

Now, as long as you did not use CONST, you can change the value of the variable at any time

  ```javascript
  math = 1+2+1
  ```

---
# Using Variables

**Here's the most important part:** you can use your variables in any other place in your code and it's like you typed in the value referred to by the variable:

If the 'math' variable is set this way:
  ```javascript
  math = 1+2+1
  ```

Than later in your code if you use **math**, the computer will _replace_ "math" with the number 4.

So typeing '10 + **math**' is the same as typing '10 + 4'.

# Syntax
## Syntax is the ORDER that you're ALLOWED to put Variables and keywords in your program

- Syntax is similar in the English language - verbs, nouns and punctuation have to be in the right order in sentence, otherwise it might not be understood
- If your Syntax is wrong, your progarm might run things in the wrong order or simply not work at all
>> "Syntax is probably the toughest hurdle for new programmers to overcome"
-- Java Developer

# More on Syntax

Documentation of any computer technologies will often dictate what syntax or signature should be used. 

```javascript
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
```
The above syntax says that when defining a function:
- the keyword ```function``` must com first
- then the ```name``` of the function
- then it's ```parameters``` in parenthesis ```()```
- finally the code of the function in brackets ```{}```

---
# More on Syntax
## Syntax is the difference between coding languages

Where in one language you'll use brackets, 
another may use braces and in another parenthesis

---
# Control Structures
## Rules and instructions for how to manipulate data under different conditions or until a certain condition is met

Real-life parallels:
- the instructions given to a bar tender not to let anyone in under 21 years of age
- the instructions for a baker to fold and roll dough exactly 4 times
- the instructions for a car owner to fill their tires with air only up to a certain PSI
